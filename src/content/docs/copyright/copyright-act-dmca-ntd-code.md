The Copyright Act refers to a set of laws that govern copyright protection in various jurisdictions. In the United States, it's formally known as the Copyright Act of 1976, which outlines the rights and protections granted to creators of original works, including literary, artistic, musical, and other intellectual creations.

DMCA stands for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a U.S. copyright law enacted in 1998. It addresses various issues related to digital copyright infringement, including the protection of copyrighted materials online, safe harbor provisions for internet service providers, and procedures for addressing copyright infringement claims.

NTD Code stands for Notice-and-Takedown Code, which is part of the DMCA. It outlines the process through which copyright holders can request the removal of infringing content from online platforms. The code establishes procedures that online service providers must follow when they receive notices of copyright infringement, including the prompt removal of the allegedly infringing content and provisions for counter-notification by users who believe their content was wrongly removed.

These legal frameworks play a significant role in balancing the rights of copyright holders with the interests of content creators and the public, particularly in the digital age where sharing and distributing copyrighted materials online are prevalent. They aim to provide mechanisms for protecting intellectual property while also fostering innovation, creativity, and the free flow of information.
