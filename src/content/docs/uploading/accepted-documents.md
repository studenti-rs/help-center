At studenti.rs, we accept documents in the following formats: **PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT and PPTX**.

To ensure the best user experience, we consider the demand, quality, and uniqueness of the documents. **Generally, lecture notes (created by you), exercises, summaries, essays, and other useful materials are approved.**

Please note the following guidelines:

- **Restricted formats**: photographs, scans, and low-resolution files are usually not approved. These types of documents may be difficult for our system and other students to read.
- **Restricted content**: Lecture slides, books, readily available online content, copyrighted documents, and duplicate content will not be approved.

We strive to maintain a high standard of quality and usefulness for the documents shared on our platform.
