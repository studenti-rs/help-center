When you upload study materials to our platform, our system performs a thorough check to ensure they meet our criteria. Your documents are checked for uniqueness by comparing them against our database, as well as billions of other web pages and archives.

Please note: **If your document doesn't meet our criteria, it will be deleted.** We don't publish previously deleted materials that don't meet our standards.
